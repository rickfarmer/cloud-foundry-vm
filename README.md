================

The Cloud Foundry VM is a quick way to spin up a complete development instance quickly in a self-contained VM.  No need to install the complete toolchain and configure your local environment with the layers of tooling needed to run Bosh Lite.  Instead the Cloud Foundry VM automatically provisions and configures a VM containing Bosh Lite running Cloud Foundry using the Vagrant DevOps tool with Chef and shell-scripts.
